# Create/POST Routes

## Lesson Objectives

1. Create a post route
1. Test your route with Postman
1. View body of the post request

## Create a post route

Lets set up a route to listen to a post request for a fruit

```javascript
router.post('/', (req, res)=>{
  console.log('POST route')
  res.send('POST - data received');
});
```

### Test with Postman 

- Open up a new tab in Postman
- Set your type of request to `POST`
- Set the correct request url `localhost:3000`

## Define middleware

Express comes with a method called `.use()` that allows us to execute some logic for all routes.  In order to signal that the middleware is complete we call  `next()`.

The instructor will demo middleware.  You are free to code along but this is just a demo of visualizing where middleware is used. 

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log('I run for all routes')
    next();
});
```

<hr>

Be sure to put middleware at the top of your server.js file, so that other routes don't handle the request and send the response before the middleware can be executed


## View body of a post request

The POST request to our sever has data in it (name, color, readyToEat, etc). We can easily access this data with a middleware function. 

Let's configure express to use the middleware tha twill allow us to accept incoming data.  We will add the following two `middleware` that are provided by express.

- `express.urlencoded()` is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as strings or arrays. 
- `express.json()` is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. 


```js
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended:false}));
app.use(express.json())
```

Now inside the POST to `/fruits` route handler we can do the following:

```javascript
router.post('/', (req, res)=>{
    console.log('POST - req.body', req.body);
    res.send('data received');
});
```


Push this data into our fruits array:

```javascript
router.post('/', (req, res)=>{
    fruits.push(req.body);
    console.log(fruits);
    res.send('data received');
});
```

## Test with Postman
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/516/1*MP7BSXKJrQzCz_aI2zJr-g.png" width="300px" >

- Open up a new tab in postman
- Set your type of request to `POST`
- Set the correct request url `localhost:3000`
- Make sure you are using `x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Add content to the Body tab


### Bonus - Sending Data as JSON

The instructor will walk through a demo of sending data as `form-data` and `JSON` instead of `x-www-form-urlencoded`

### More on form-data / vs form-urlencoded in Postman

##### form-data

multipart/form-data is the default encoding a web form uses to transfer data. This simulates filling a form on a website, and submitting it. The form-data editor lets you set key/value pairs (using the key-value editor) for your data. You can attach files to a key as well. Do note that due to restrictions of the HTML5 spec, files are not stored in history or collections. You would have to select the file again at the time of sending a request.

#### urlencoded

This encoding is the same as the one used in URL parameters. You just need to enter key/value pairs and Postman will encode the keys and values properly. Note that you can not upload files through this encoding mode. There might be some confusion between form-data and urlencoded so make sure to check with your API first.
