# What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for **C**`reate`, **R**`ead`, **U**`pdate` and **D**`elete`. Why and how is this important you ask? Well CRUD is in everything you interact with online on a daily basis. Browsing Instagram and looking at posts? Thats **R**`ead`. Are you posting something? Well that's **C**`reate`. Didn't like that picture you posted? **D**`elete` to the rescue and finally, liking pictures of adorable animals? Hello **U**`date`!

So now that we have a reference point, how does that relate to code?

Below you'll find a table that relates normal `HTTP` actions to our CRUD operators.

| HTTP Action | CRUD Operator |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| GET         | Read          |
| POST        | Create        |
| PUT         | Update        |
| DELETE      | Delete        |

## Breaking It Down

#### Create

---

A Create or `POST` creates a new entry in a database that either you or someone else created. When we perform a `POST` request, we send some amount of information to our data source, usually data from a form; and we create a new entry in the data source.

#### Read

---

The `Read` or `GET` operation is something that you interact with every day. Whenever you pull information from an api, you are performing a `GET` request. `GET` requests only allow users to view or read from a data source. This can be something as simple as you checking your email in the morning. We perform a `GET` request to a server and if everything goes OK we get some type of information or data back.

#### Update

---

Update or `PUT` works very similar to a `POST` request. We are still sending along some sort of data to our data source, but instead of creating a new entry, we are actually updating an existing entry. In order to this, we need to target that entry specifically, most of the times using an `id`. This allows us to send some new information to to our existing piece of data and overwrite it's existing attributes.

#### Delete

---

Delete does just as the name implies, it `DELETE`'s something from our data source. We target the specific piece of information in the same way we did with our `PUT` request. This sends a request to the server to `DELETE` this item.

## Describe REST and list the various routes

- REST stands for Representational state transfer
- It's just a set of principles that describe how networked resources are accessed and manipulated
- We have [7 RESTful routes](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/09939db6f81d654af06b) that allow us basic operations for reading and manipulating a collection of data:

| **URL** | **HTTP Verb** |  **Action**|
|------------|-------------|------------|
| /photos/         | GET       | index  
| /photos/new      | GET       | new   
| /photos          | POST      | create   
| /photos/:id      | GET       | show       
| /photos/:id/edit | GET       | edit       
| /photos/:id      | PATCH/PUT | update    
| /photos/:id      | DELETE    | destroy  


**note** We will not map our crud functionality directly to REST. These are just some common and conventional rest endpoints we will use to create our routes.

## Create an Index route

## Setup our app

1.  Create a directory in student examples called `fruits` (you will be using this folder over the next few days)
1. `touch server.js`
1. `npm init -y`
1. install express
1. require express and set up a basic server that logs listening when you start the app


### Startup Stricts

Let's revisit adding startup script to `package.json` and add the following: 

- start - runs `node server.js`
- dev - runs `nodemon server.js`

express-api/package.json
```js
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

Create a .gitignore file `touch .gitignore`!

```sh
/node_modules
.DS_Store
```

### Environment Variables

Currently you are using your computer's `nodejs` as your environment. This is different than the environment in the browser. If you were to try run the `alert()` function in your `server.js` it would give an error - because the browser and node are two different environments that both run JavaScript.

If you wanted to collaborate on this project, you'd likely have your collaborator get a copy of your code from github.

They would be running the app on their environment(computer).

If you were to host your app on the internet on a virtual server, you'd likely need to set different environment variables than the ones you have on your computer.

Let's say you want to run this app on port `3000`. Your collaborator wants to run it on port `3001` and your hosted version on the internet wants to run it on port `8888`.

You could, constantly update it in your `server.js`... but that seems problematic.

A better option would be to add another npm package like `dotenv`

Let's install the package.

```js
npm i dotenv
```

Let's take a look at the [dotenv docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and determine how to use the package. 

<hr>

So it seems this is how we import and initialize it. 

```js
require('dotenv').config()
```

The tool will automatically look for a file called `.env` so let's create that now. 

`touch .env` on the same level of `server.js`

Update `.gitignore` to include `.env`

```yml
node_modules
.env
```

As per the docs, no spaces, no commas, no semi-colons. If you have a second variable, you would put it on the next line.

In `.env` add the following.

```yml
PORT=3000
```

In `server.js` update the port to reference the port assigned in the file. 

```js
const port = process.env.PORT 
```

Start the server and make sure it's still configured to listen on port 3000

**NOTE:** Your environmental variables are yours, and should be private. If you put them on github everyone can see!  So you should have git ignore them.



Start the app with `nodemon` and make sure it is working


## Lets build our Fruits app!

Let's have a set of resources which is just a javascript array.  To create an index route, we'd do the following:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear'];

app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(fruits);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('listening');
});
```


## Create a Show route

To create a show route, we'd do this:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear'];

app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(fruits);
});

//add show route
app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', (req, res) => {
    res.send(fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray]);
});

app.listen(port,function(){
    console.log('listening');
});
```

Now go to http://localhost:3000/fruits/1

## Enhance the data in your data array

- Right now are data array `fruits` is just an array of strings
- We can store anything in the array, though.
- Let's enhance our data a bit:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;


const fruits = [
    {
        name:'apple',
        color: 'red',
        readyToEat: true
    },
    {
        name:'pear',
        color: 'green',
        readyToEat: false
    },
    {
        name:'banana',
        color: 'yellow',
        readyToEat: true
    }
];

app.get('/fruits/', (req, res) => {
    res.send(fruits);
});

app.get('/fruits/:indexOfFruitsArray', (req, res) => {
    res.send(fruits[req.params.indexOfFruitsArray]);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('listening');
});
```

### Bonus - Morgan Logger

This is a good point to integrate better logging. Right now, if we check our terminal when we hit the http://localhost:3000/fruits endpoint we see more about the communication between client and server.  

For debugging purposes and overall better logging we're going to use an express middleware called [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan):

```sh
npm install morgan --save-dev
```

Add the following to your server.js file:

```js
const logger = require('morgan');
app.use(logger('dev'))
```

Startup your server and let's see the result by going to 

```sh
http://localhost:3000/fruits
```
